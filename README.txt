This is the version in development -- please use the version in upper folder for testing!

The purpose of this project is to create a MATLAB-based GUI that can

1) Load and visualize both EEG (mff format recorded by NetStation) and video
2) The video can be played (with audio) synchronized with EEG
3) A user can drop markers (with designated types) at a time of choice

System requirements (has been tested on):

1) Mac OS Ventura 13.6.7
2) MATLAB 2021b
3) (required) VLC media player 3.0.16 Vetinari (Intel 64bit)
4) EEGLAB 2021

Notes:
1) EEG has to be in .mff format
2) Video has to be in .mov format and is in the .mff file
3) Output is currently saved in a newly created "HE" folder within the data folder
